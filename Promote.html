      Both Peter Parker and Miles Morales have changed since their previous games, which 
means how they play has also evolved. Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned 
web-head to their slick moves, there’s plenty to get stuck into.
   </p>


   <div class="text2">
      <p>Wall-crawlers’ gadgets have been improved to integrate even better with the combo system,
          which only adds to the improvisational fun that makes you truly feel like Spider-Man, 
          as you can begin an air combo with the enemy-launching Symbiote Strike, or yank hapless 
          opponents together with the Web Grabber and follow it up with further attacks.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="text3">

      <p>The new parry mechanic is essential to dealing with some of the undodgeable strikes 
         particular enemies use. You can still swing away to escape, but a well-timed parry
          not only stops the incoming attack but leaves an enemy vulnerable to further damage.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="text4">

      <p>And then there's the new Web Line mechanic which lets you craft your own high 
         wire paths across specific points in the environment, giving you even more
          control and flexibility over stealth takedowns. </p>

   <p>
      Building on top of the classic web-swinging fun that the previous two 
      games delivered, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 introduces the ability to glide using Web Wings. 
      But they aren’t just a flashy addition from the comics and movies – they entirely change 
      how you navigate around Marvel’s New York.
   </p>
   
<div class="text6">

   <p> Now you can build up height and speed with web-swinging before 
      quickly switching to Web Wings to glide in areas like Queens, 
      where there are few tall buildings. With the new interactive 
      elements like super slingshots and wind tunnels that act as jet 
      streams, Spider-Man has never been faster in the air.</p>

</div>


<div class="text7">

   <p>With the Spider-Men slinging around some serious upgrades, it makes sense that the 
      skill trees have experienced a boost, too. There are now three different skill trees to develop as 
      the game progresses. The two individual strands focus on what makes each hero unique, such as Miles’ 
      bioelectricity and invisibility, and Peter’s Spider-Arms and Symbiote powers. </p>


 <div class="text8">

   <p>However, there’s now a third strand shared by both characters, which is something 
      entirely new to the series. With it you can build on the combat and traversal skills 
      that you would want in either Spider-Man, creating a more rounded – and appropriately – symbiotic duo.</p>

<p>Marvel’s New York will naturally be hiding lots of enigmatic and rewarding secrets
    in its streets and skylines, but one thing which has been given a Super Hero
     glow-up are the suits you can unlock for Miles and Peter.</p>


     <div class="text10">

      <p>With new suit styles you can vary different colour patterns to spin your 
         Spider-Man a fresh look, but the new suit tech system allows you to upgrade various 
         attributes, like traversal, damage and health. And from that you can make even more choices
          to equip specific elements of that attribute. In short, your Spider-Man is tailor-made to your needs.</p>
