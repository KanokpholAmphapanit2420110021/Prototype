   <p>It is an alien symbiote that bonds with human bodies to use as hosts. The symbiote briefly 
      appears in the endings of both the first game and Miles Morales, where Harry Osborn was confirmed to be its host, 
      where it plays a vital role in the plot of the second game, posing as and initially being thought of as a bio-exo suit 
      created to treat Harry's illness in Act I. After temporarily leaving Harry to bond with Peter Parker, where over the course of Act II it's
       true nature as a symbiote is revealed, it eventually returns to Harry, now calling itself Venom, becoming the game's sole main antagonist from
        Act III onwards following it's murder of Kraven at the end of Act II.</p>
